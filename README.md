# About
 We work with texts quite often, and it's very sad when it turns out that the text should have been written in a different case. Instead of editing it, I created a simple application that does the job for us.
### UpperCase 
It Converts all the text to upper case
### LowerCase
It converts all the text to lower case
### ProperCase 
It converts the first letter of every word to upper case and the rest to lower case
### SentenceCase 
It converts the first letter of the first word of every sentence to upperCase and the rest to lower case
### Download
It downloads a text.txt file where there's the modified text.
